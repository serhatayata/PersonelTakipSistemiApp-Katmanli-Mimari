I have created this app by abiding the SOLID principles and layered architecture.

There are many pages you can use to manage your employees, their roles and information.

If you want to enter the platform, first you should know your user number and password or you cannot enter the platform.

There are 2 types of users, administrators and normal users.

If you are an administrator you can also insert, update and delete information which is stored in SQL database.
There is also a button on the pages that you can use to get the info via excel.
